**VICERA** is a fantasy console where you can program your own games. It is currently in development and not even at a usable state. Here are the planned features :

   - a 8-bit CPU inspired of the Gameboy CPU architecture
   - 256x256 monochrome display
   - 64 kilobytes of RAM
   - Simple sound processing unit
   - Sprite and tiles support

There is not much but this is what I am planning for now. This is still an awesome project to work on. Once finished, I will make a one or a few games on it and document all the VICERA.

More information about how to use it, how to make a game, how to compile and install it, etc. Will come later when the project will arrive at a usable state. There is not much for now.
