[[[ IMPORTANT ]]]

PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS ASSEMBLER, IT IS COMPLETELY DEPRECATED.

This is a small assembler quickly written in Python so I can write small
programs to debug and test the Vicera. A better assembler is planned. For now,
please use this assembler. It lacks lots of features. I am also really bad at
programming assemblers so also don't expect the final assembler to be great.

Hope you will like this assembler anyways.
